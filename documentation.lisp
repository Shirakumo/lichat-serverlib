 * LICHAT-PROTOCOL:UPDATE -- The update is handled accordingly.

If an error of type FAILURE-CONDITION is signalled during the
evaluation of non-around methods, the encapsulated failure update
is sent to the connection. If an error of type LICHAT-PROTOCOL:
PROTOCOL-CONDITION is signalled during the evaluation of non-around
methods, an update of type LICHAT-PROTOCOL:FAILURE is sent to the
connection.

A CONTINUE restart is established around the method that can be
used to respond with a generic LICHAT-PROTOCOL:UPDATE-FAILURE
and return from the PROCESS method.

This method will also take care to handle flooding and timeout
recording for the connection.

The overarching server must establish a restart called CLOSE-
CONNECTION around the PROCESS method, or around all calls of it.
When this restart is invoked, the server must close the underlying
connection.
